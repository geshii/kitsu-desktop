## THIS PROJECT IS DISCONTINUED 
Thanks to everyone who supported the project, but since I'm now the only one who works on it (syslambda left a few months ago), and I'm currently working on bigger projects I don't have the time, the motivation and the inspiration to continue this. If someone wants to work using kitsu-desktop for another open-source project, please @ me in the repo, or dm me on Twitter. See y'all later
